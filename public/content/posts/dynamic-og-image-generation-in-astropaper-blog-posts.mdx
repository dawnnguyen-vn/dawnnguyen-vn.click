## [Features & Changes]

### Type-safe Frontmatters and Redefined Blog Schema

Frontmatter of AstroPaper 2.0 markdown contents are now type-safe thanks to Astroâ€™s Content Collections. Blog schema is defined inside the `src/content/_schemas.ts` file.

### New Home for Blog contents

All the blog posts were moved from `src/contents` to `src/content/blog` directory.

### New Fetch API

Contents are now fetched with `getCollection` function. No relative path to the content needs to be specified anymore.

```ts
// old content fetching method
- const postImportResult = import.meta.glob<MarkdownInstance<Frontmatter>>(
  "../contents/**/**/*.md",);

// new content fetching method
+ const postImportResult = await getCollection("blog");
```

### Modified Search Logic for better Search Result

In the older version of AstroPaper, when someone search some article, the search criteria keys that will be searched are `title`, `description` and `headings` (heading means all the headings h1 ~ h6 of the blog post). In AstroPaper v2, only `title` and `description` will be searched as the user types.

### Renamed Frontmatter Properties
